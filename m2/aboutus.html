  <h1> About Us </h1>
  <h2> Inspire the Kids’ World </h2>
  <p> Children clothes store based in Singapore, FRIAS aim to inspire the kids’ world. We are committed to make the highest quality and most comfortable clothes for kids of all ages. Our value-added service such as full body measurement makes sure every kid gets their best-fit clothes. </p>
  <h2> Sustainability </h2>
  <p> We are concerned about sustainability, therefore we arrange some occasional events to support our interest. We have fashion show for new designers so they can introduce their products. We believe that giving chance to new designers has a big impact to make fashion sustainable. </p>
  <p> Our motto is to inspire kids' world. We believe that education is important and has a big role in inspiring children, but unfortunately there are still many children who do not get proper education. We notice that so we arrange school fundraising and charity through fashion shows. </p>
